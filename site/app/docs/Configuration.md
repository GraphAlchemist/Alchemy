# Overview
Alchemy.js is initialized using the `alchemy.begin(your_config)` where the **your_config** object includes any of the configurations here that you would like to override.

The only configuration absolutely necessary is the [dataSource](#dataSource) configuration.  See the [Quick Start](../#quick-start) or [Examples](../../examples) for more examples of how to initialize Alchemy.js.

Additionally, configurations for any app are available at the alchemy.conf endpoint after the app has been initialized.

# Nodes
#####nodeCaption
[string|function] **default**: `"caption"`    
The configuration for the text that will appear as the caption on a node used during filtering and searching.  The string parameter defined should provide a key within the GraphJSON.  By default alchemy will look for a "caption" key on each node in the graphJSON, however any key present on *some* or *all* of the nodes can be provided.  The user can also provide a function.  The function can take **node** as a parameter and that will use the node objects in the GraphJSON to build the caption.  For example, where the GraphJSON node objects contain "firstName" and "lastName".:
```javascript
caption: function(node) {
    return "" + node.firstName + " " + node.lastName;
  }
```
```json
"nodes": [
        {
            ...
            "firstName": "Kate",
            "lastName": "Smith"
        },
            ...]
```

#####fixNodes
[bool] **default**: `false`     
All nodes are draggable by default.  Setting to `true` means that nodes will not be draggable after their initial layout.

#####fixRootNodes
[bool] **default**: `false`     
Root nodes are draggable by default. Setting to `true` means that root nodes cannot be dragged after their initial layout.  You can find more information on how to define root nodes in the GraphJSON [here](../GraphJSON/#defining-root-nodes).

#####nodeColour
[css color value] **default**: `null`    
This is a convenience parameter to quickly assign a default color to all nodes.  This method will overwrite any styles assigned by the css.  For more on how to assign colors to specific nodes read about [nodeTypes](#nodetypes) and our [guide to graph styling](../GraphStyling).

#####nodeMouseOver
[string|function] **default**: "caption"    
This defines the text that will be displayed when a user mouses over a node element.  Similiar to the [alchemy.conf.nodeCaption](#nodeCaption) parameter, alchemy.conf.nodeMouseOver can receive a *string* or a *function*.  If it receives a string as in the default, it will look for that string on nodes in the graphJSON and display the text when that node is moused over.  If a function is passed, that function will be called with the **node** as an optional parameter.

For instance:
```json
{ 
    "nodeMouseOver": function(node) {
        return node.someData + node.someOtherData
}
```

#####nodeOverlap    
[integer] **default**: `24`  
Used in the collision detection function, should be a number slightly more than double the size of the [nodeRadius](#nodeRadius) and will cause the center of all nodes to be no closer than the specified distance.     
***Note***: Keep in mind that the stroke-width of the svg element is in addition to the radius of the circle svg element and therefore nodes will overlap with a value of only 2 x the nodeRadius.  For this reason, pick a number slightly greater.

#####nodeRadius   
[integer|string|function] **default**: `10`    
If the default or a user specified integer, the value will be the pixel size of a node that indicates node size.  If the user specifies a string, that string will be the key, used to look up the nodeRadius on individual nodes in the GraphJSON.  For example, GraphJSON where nodes have the following values:
```json
{"nodes":[
    {"id": 1,
     "betweeness": 0.2}
    {"id": 2,
     "betweeness": 0.3},
    ...],
...}
```
If the user specifies `alchemy.conf.nodeRadius: "betweeness"` the nodes will be sized at 0.2px and 0.3px respectively - which will not be super useful from a visualization perspective.  So, additionally the user can specify a function that will return node size.  If the user specifies the following function, they will get something more useful for visualization - a range of values between 15px and 30px scaled based on the betweenness value of the nodes:
```javascript
alchemy.conf.nodeRadius: function(n) {
        return Math.max(15, Math.min(Math.floor(n.betweeness * 100), 30))
};
```

#####rootNodeRadius
[integer] **default**: `15`    
The default size of root node(s).  Read more about how to define root nodes in your GraphJSON [here](../GraphJSON/#defining-root-nodes).

#####nodeTypes
[object|string] **default**:  `null`    
Passing a string will cause Alchemy.js to build and assign node types based on all possible filters from the GraphJSON.  For instance, if you assign "_type", "category", "foobar", etc. Alchemy.js will look for that key on every node in the GraphJSON.  This is a convenience feature and can be costly with larger data sets.

The better way to build node Parameters is to pass an object for the **nodeTypes** parameter. The object passed will correspond to keys and values in the GraphJSON that alchemy will use to build and create node types. For Example, based on the following GraphJSON, the user would pass the following object to alchemy.conf.nodeTypes for the "award" and "movie" nodes: `{type: ["award", "movie"]}`.  Visit our [examples gallery](../../examples) for full examples using nodeTypes for filters and [styling](../GraphStyling).
```json
{"nodes": [
        {
            "name": "Making Sandwiches",
            "mid": "/m/09v95qs",
            "label": "Making Sandwiches",
            "node_type": "movie",
            "genre": [
                "Short Film"
            ],
            "type": "movie",
            "id": 670298
        },
        {
            "name": "Academy Award for Actress in a Leading Role",
            "mid": "/m/0gqwc",
            "label": "Academy Award for Actress in a Leading Role",
            "node_type": "award",
            "genre": [],
            "type": "award",
            "id": 593781
        },
        {
            "name": "Religion, Inc.",
            "mid": "/m/0g5q35v",
            "label": "Religion, Inc.",
            "node_type": "movie",
            "genre": [
                "Parody",
                "Comedy"
            ],
            "type": "movie",
            "id": 778069
        },...],
...}
```

#Edges

<!-- #####edgeCaption:
**not currently implemented**
[string] `'caption'` Just like nodes, edges can store descriptive data.  The edgeCaption is the text that will display 'on hover' and by default alchemy looks for 'caption' in the corresponding edge object from the GraphJSON. -->

#####edgeStyle
[css style value] **default**: `null`
A function that assigns custom edge styling.  Should return a string that is a valid value to the "style" svg attribute in css.  If `alchemy.conf.cluster` is `true` then styling is assigned by edge gradients take priority.  Read more about the [[`cluster` configuration|Layout#cluster]].

#####edgeTypes 
[array of strings|object] **default**: `null`    
Similiar to [nodeTypes](#nodeTypes), a string value will cause Alchemy.js to create an index of edgeTypes based on looking up the values for the parameter on each edge in the GraphJSON.  Below **caption** would create edgeTypes based on the captions provided.  This is a convenience function and can become very costly on larger data sets.

The correct way to define edgeTypes is by passing an object.  The object passed should correspond to keys and values in the GraphJSON that alchemy will use to create filters. For Example, based on the following GraphJSON, you would pass `{"caption": ["acted in", "parent of"]}` to tell Alchemy.js to look for a "caption" key on each edge, and then build types for "acted in" and "parent of" edges.  These types can be used for [edge filters](#edgeFilters) as well as [styling](../GraphStyling).
```json
"edges": [
 {
            "source": 95421,
            "target": 714293,
            "caption": "acted in"
        },
        {
            "source": 95421,
            "taget": 95426,
            "caption": "parent of"
        },
        {
            "source": 95421,
            "role": "Devlin Moran",
            "target": 603720,
            "caption": "acted in"
        },...]
...}
```

#Editing

#####showEditor
[bool] **default**: `false`    
When both `showEditor` and [`showControlDash`](#showControlDash) are true, creates an Editor menu where you can directly edit elements on the graph. If `showControlDash` is false, then the editor menu will not be visible. When the editor is showing in the Control Dash, there are currently two options, remove element and editor interactions. When the editor interactions are enabled, adding nodes and edges is a simple as clicking and dragging.

#####removeElement
[bool] **default**: `false`    
Adds a "Remove Element" button to the editor dropdown in the control dash.  When clicked, it will remove any selected node or edge.  Keep in mind this is to completely remove the element, not hide it.

<!-- #####addNodes:
[bool] `false`    
**not currently implemented** Adds an "Add node" button to the editor dropdown in the control dash.  When clicked, it will insert a new node into the graph. -->

<!-- #####addEdges:
[bool] `false`    
**not currently implemented** Adds an "Add edge" button to the editor dropdown in the control dash.  When clicked, it will insert a new node into the graph. Note that an edge cannot exist without both a source and a target node.-->

___

#Filtering

#####showFilters
[bool] **default**: `false`    
When both `showFilters` and `showControlDash` are true, creates a filter menu that contains different types of graph filters.  [`showControlDash`](#showControlDash) must be true in order for the filters menu to be visible.  Current elements in the filters menu are [edgeFilters](#edgeFilters), [nodeFilters](#nodeFilters), [captionToggle](#captionToggle), [edgesToggle](#edgesToggle), [nodesToggle](#nodesToggle), and [toggleRootNodes](#toggleRootNodes).

#####edgeFilters
[bool] **default**: `false`    
If set to true, alchemy will load a set of filters that correspond to edge types defined in the [`edgeTypes`](#edgetypes) parameter, into the filters section of the control dash.

#####nodeFilters
[bool] **default**: `false`    
If set to true, alchemy will load a set of filters that correspond to node types as defined in the [`nodeTypes`](#nodetypes) into the filters section of the control dash.

#####captionsToggle 
[bool] **default**: `false`    
Allow toggling of caption visibility.  When toggled, `.hidden` is assigned to all captions.  The default `hidden` class can easily be overwritten to allow different colors or opacities for node captions when hidden.  See [graph styling](../GraphStyling) for examples of use cases.

#####edgesToggle
[bool] **default**: `false`      
Allow toggling of edge visibility.  When toggled, `.hidden` is assigned to all edges.  The default `hidden` class can easily be overwritten to include different levels of opacity or color upon toggle.  See [graph styling](../GraphStyling) for examples of use cases.

#####nodesToggle
[bool] **default**: `false`    
Allow toggling of node visibility.  When toggled, `.hidden` is assigned to all nodes.  The default `hidden` class can easily be overwritten to include different levels of opacity or color upon toggle.  When used in tandem with [edgesToggle](#edgesToggle) nodes can be removed with edges still being visible.  Nodes toggle is also useful for applying a custom set of styles for the `.hidden` class that is applied to all nodes on toggle.  See [graph styling](../GraphStyling) for examples of use cases.

<!-- #####toggleRootNodes   
[bool] `true`    
If true a t -->

<!-- #####edgesTagsFilter:
[array of strings|object] `false`
**not currently implemented**
 -->
<!-- #####nodesTagsFilter:
[array of strings|object] `false`
**not currently implemented**

#Layout

#####graphHeight
[function] **default**: [See source.](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy/blob/master/app/scripts/alchemy/defaultConf.coffee#L20)

Defaults to a function that selects the height of the enclosing div.  If there is no enclosing div, the function returns the screen height on load.  The user can define there own custom function for graphHeight or a function that returns an integer to be converted to pixels.  e.g. `function() {return 500}`

#####graphWidth
[function] **default**: [See source.](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy/blob/master/app/scripts/alchemy/defaultConf.coffee#L22)

Defaults to a function that selects the height of the enclosing div.  If there is no enclosing div, the function returns the screen width on load.  The user can define there own custom function for **graphWidth** or a function that returns an integer to be converted to pixels.  e.g. `function() {return 500}`

#####alpha 
[float] **default**: `0.5`    
Is a part of the d3 force layout, `alpha` sets the cooling parameter for the force layout.  You can read more about how changing the default value for alpha can change the force layout in the [d3 docs](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout#alpha).

#####cluster
[bool] **default**: `false`     
Clustering nodes will have a major effect on layout and color and is one of Alchemy's most powerful off the shelf features..  To cluster nodes, simply set cluster to `true`. Alchemy.js will expect a 'cluster' key for each node in the provided GraphJSON whose value is an integer.  For example:    
```json
{
    "edges":[...
    ],    
    "nodes": [
        {
            "cluster": 4,
            "degree": 8,
            "id": "P7jQJNVTAG",
            "firstName": "Kate",
        },
        {
            "cluster": 0,
            "degree": 19,
            "id": "fPKtFfXDds",
            "firstName": "Katherine",
        },
        {
            "cluster": 0,
            "degree": 4,
            "id": "QgVAXaBQg2",
            "firstName": "Duane",
        },...
    ]
}
```
The value for cluster will be used to look up a color from [`alchemy.conf.clusterColours`](#clusterColours).  All nodes of the same cluster will receive the same colour.  Edges between nodes of the same cluster will receive that cluster's colour, while edges that span between two nodes in different clusters will receive an inverse gradient of the colours of the two colours.  This makes it easy to visually identify 'boundary spanners' in social networks, unexpected links in a host of network analysis and link analysis use cases, and even to visually illustrate results of gene co-expression networks.  For example:
![cluster](../img/cluster.png)    
<!-- TODO: cluster should accept a string e.g. "community" "category" etc. that would correspond to the key in the graph JSON-->

#####clusterColours
[array of css colors] **default**:
```js
d3.shuffle(["#DD79FF", "#FFFC00", "#00FF30", "#5168FF", "#00C0FF", 
            "#FF004B", "#00CDCD", "#f83f00", "#f800df", "#ff8d8f",
            "#ffcd00", "#184fff", "#ff7e00"])
```
Provides a list of colors that can be assigned to different clusters.  The above colors are the defaults that are randomly assigned to the clusters using the [d3.shuffle](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Arrays#d3_shuffle) method.  Colours can be predictably assigned to colours by simply providing the colours in the position of the corresponding cluster.  For instance, in an array of the following colours `[red, green, yellow, orange]`, cluster 0 would be red, cluster 1 would be green, cluster 2 would be yellow, cluster orange would be 3, etc.  See [cluster](#cluster) for more information on how clustering works in Alchemy.js.

#####forceLocked
[bool] **default**: `true`    
By default that force layout does not continue after initial layout is performed.  Setting **forceLocked** to `false` will allow the force layout to run on node drag, click, and other interactions.

#####linkDistance 
[function] **default**: [See source.](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy/blob/master/app/scripts/alchemy/core/layout.coffee#L137)    
Alchemy.js provides the ability for a user defined custom link distance function in the force layout.  If you wish to override the default value with a function or provide another static value, simply pass it as the value for linkDistance in the config.  Your custom function will have the edge as well as our layout constant [k](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy/blob/master/app/scripts/alchemy/core/startGraph.coffee#L79) available.  For example, `yourLinkDistanceFn: function(edge, k) { return edge.something * k}`
Read more about how linkDistance is used in d3's force layout [here](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout#linkDistance).

<!-- #####nodePositions:
[array] `null` 
**not currently implemented**
Per the [GraphJSON](http://www.graphjson.org/) specifications, users can provide GraphJSON with nodes that contain pre-calculated layout positions for nodes in pixel length.  The nodePositions parameter tells alchemy where to look up the node position.  The most obvious parameter for the user to pass would be `["x","y"]` telling alchemy to look for the `x` position for nodes with the `"x"` key on each node where available, and the `y` position with the "y" key.  A user could just as easily define a custom set of keys for their GraphJSON.  For example, ["apples","oranges"] would tell alchemy to look for the x position of nodes with the `"apples"` key and the `y` position of nodes with the `"oranges"` key. -->

____


#Search
##### search
[bool] **default** `true`
Adds a search box to the control dash that searches through node captions.  Will not do anything if showControlDash is set to `false`.

##### searchMethod
[string] **default** `"contains"`
Defines the criteria search uses to find nodes.  If string is set to "contains", it will select all nodes that contain the search string.  If string is set to "begins", it will select all nodes that begin with the search string.
____


#Other
##### dataSource     
[string, object] **default:** `null`    
Does not receive a default value and is the single parameter that **must** be defined by the user in order to use Alchemy.js.  `dataSource` receives either a string specifying the location of a GraphJSON object, or a GraphJSON formatted object directly.  If the user specifies a string, Alchemy.js will use d3's [`d3.json` method](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Requests#d3_json) with the string as the data source and the graph viz app as the callback.  If an object is specified, the graph viz will use the object directly as a data source.

##### divSelector
[any css3 selector] **default**: '#alchemy'     
This is the element that Alchemy.js will look for when creating the visualization.  By default alchemy looks for an element with id "alchemy."

##### showControlDash
[bool] **default**: `false`    
The control dash is the element that houses search, filters, and editor functions.  **showControlDash** must be true in order for all other functionality to be visible to the end user.

#####initialScale    
[integer] **default**: `1`      
Specifies the initial distance of the zoom on the svg.  A value assiged here initiates "scale" value directly in the svg's "transform" attribute.

#####initialTranslate        
[2 integer array] **default:**`[0,0]`  
Specifies the initial "pan" of the svg, corresponding directly to the "translate" value in the svg's "transform" attribute.  Because graphs layout differently every time, and because there is currently not support for setting initial node positions, there is limited utility to setting different values for the "translate" of the svg.

#####warningMessage     
[string] **default:** `"There be no data!  What's going on?"`  
Specifies a custom warning message if there is no data.

#####afterLoad         
[str, function] **default:** 'afterLoad'      
If `afterLoad` receives a string, that string is passed to `alchemy` as a top level key that returns `true` when the graph has loaded.  This maybe helpful for certain applications where the graph context is being watch and events can be fired when `alchemy.afterLoad` or `alchemy.someOtherString` is `true`.

If `afterLoad` receives a function, that function is simply run after the graph is drawn.  E.g. `alchemy.someFunction()`

#####scaleExtent
[two integer array] **default**: [0.5, 2.4]    
Defines the farthest that the user will be able to zoom in and out.  This applies minmimum and maximum values directly to the transform "scale()" attr of the svg.

#####zoomControls
[bool] **default**: false    
When set to true, adds zoom in, zoom out, and reset buttons to the svg.
