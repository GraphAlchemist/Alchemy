Alchemy.js is a graph drawing application built in [d3](http://d3js.org/).

Alchemy.js was built so that developers could easily get up and running with Graph visualization applications, and not much over head.  Minimal code is actually required to generate Alchemy.js graphs with most projects. Most customization of the application takes place by overriding default configurations, rather than direct implementation via JavaScript.

Additionally, because Alchemy.js is built with d3, the core application can easily be extended with any of the other features included in d3.
